First successful iteration created a simple network which could only very slightly imitate the style of the chosen artist (Ad Reinhardt in the delauny dataset)
This is most likely due to either too short of a training time (100 epochs) or the GAN diverging from the expected outcome
It is much more likely that the small sample size is what caused the poor output as there was never a point where the generator improved against the discriminator
