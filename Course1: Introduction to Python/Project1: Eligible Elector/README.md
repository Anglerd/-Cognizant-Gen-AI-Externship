Hey Python Wizard! ðŸ§™
Letâ€™s make something cool and useful! Youâ€™ll be writing a program to check voter eligibility. Itâ€™s simple, but the result is super satisfying. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll build:

Step 1: Ask the Userâ€™s Age
Your program should start by asking the user:
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

Make sure you convert the input into an integer so you can use it in calculations later.

Step 2: Decide the Eligibility
Use a conditional statement to check if the age is 18 or older. Hereâ€™s the logic:

    If the userâ€™s age is 18 or above, display a warm message like:
    "Congratulations! You are eligible to vote. Go make a difference!"
    If the userâ€™s age is less than 18, calculate how many years they have to wait. Display a friendly message like:
    "Oops! Youâ€™re not eligible yet. But hey, only X more years to go!"

Step 3: Test with Different Ages
Hereâ€™s an example of how your program should behave:

Example Run 1:
How old are you? 16
Oops! Youâ€™re not eligible yet. But hey, only 2 more years to go!

Example Run 2:
How old are you? 20
Congratulations! You are eligible to vote. Go make a difference!

Step 4: Polish It Up
Make sure your program is friendly, clear, and fun! Add comments to explain what your code is doing and maybe throw in a fun line or emoji for extra flair.

Extra Credit:
Want to stand out? Add some checks for invalid input (like negative ages or non-numeric entries). This is optional but will definitely impress!
