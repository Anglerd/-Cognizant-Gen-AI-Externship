User Story 1: Personalized Chatbot for Customer Service 

    As a business owner, I want to create a personalized chatbot that can assist customers with frequently asked questions (FAQs) so that I can provide quick responses and improve customer satisfaction.  
    Solution: Use a pre-trained LLM like GPT and fine-tune it with customer interaction data to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. 

User Story 2: Summarization for Research Papers 

    As a researcher, I want an AI tool that can summarize lengthy research papers, allowing me to quickly grasp key findings and save time on reading, so that I can focus on analysis.  

    Solution: Use prompt engineering to guide an LLM to extract summaries from research papers, tuning the model for better accuracy and relevance. 

 User Story 3: Text-Based Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Monitoring 

    As a social media manager, I want to analyse customer sentiment based on user comments on social platforms so that I can adjust marketing strategies accordingly.  

    Solution: Fine-tune an LLM to classify sentiment in social media posts and optimize prompt design to enhance sentiment classification accuracy. 

 Implementation Plan 

 Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation 

    Task 1: Gather customer service interaction data, research papers, and social media posts for training and fine-tuning. 

    Task 2: Preprocess data to align with the input format for tokenization and embedding. 

Phase 2: Model Development 

    Task 1: Fine-tune an existing LLM (e.g., GPT) on your domain-specific data (e.g., customer service chats, research papers). 

    Task 2: Develop a custom prompt engineering strategy to guide the model's output for each use case (e.g., summarization, sentiment analysis). 

Phase 3: Model Evaluation and Tuning 

    Task 1: Evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data (testing data) using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. 

    Task 2: Fine-tune the model further based on evaluation results. 

Phase 4: Application Development 

    Task 1: Build a simple web-based application or tool where users can input text and receive model predictions. 

    Task 2: Integrate the LLM into the application to provide responses or summaries based on prompts. 

Phase 5: Testing and Deployment 

    Task 1: Conduct usability testing with real users to ensure the system meets the needs of customers, researchers, or social media managers. 

    Task 2: Deploy the application for production use, ensuring it can scale to handle multiple users.
